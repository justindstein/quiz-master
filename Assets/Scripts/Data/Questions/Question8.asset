    the battle of the Pellenor Fields?

  AnswerExplanation: Eowyn uses the name Dernhelm and disguises herself as a man.
    She gives a ride to Meriadoc, and together they ride into battle. During the
    battle, Eowyn (with Merry's help) avenges the death of Theoden by Killing the
    Witch-King of the Nazgul (leader of the black riders).
