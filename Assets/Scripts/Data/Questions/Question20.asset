  Text: Who cut the ring off Sauron's finger?
  CorrectAnswer: Isildur
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Elrond
  - Galadriel
  - Saruman
  Hints: []
  AnswerExplanation: Isildur cut the ring off Sauron's finger. Meaning to use it
    for good, he was driven to evil by the power of the ring, and the ring slipped
    off his finger. Isildur was killed, and many years later Deagol found the ring
    while fishing with Smeagol in the great river Anduin.
