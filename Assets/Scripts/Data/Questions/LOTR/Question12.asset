  Text: Who are the last two members of the fellowship who sail across the sea to
    the Undying Lands?
  CorrectAnswer: Legolas and Gimli
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Gandalf and Frodo
  - Merry and Pippin
  - Aragorn and Gandalf
  Hints: []
  AnswerExplanation: Gimli and Legolas, after many years of travels across Middle
    Earth, being the last two surviving members of the fellowship, sail across the
    sea. This occurs in The Appendix at the end of "The Return Of The King". Gandalf
    and Frodo also sailed to the Undying Lands, but that happened before Legolas
    and Gimli did so.
