  Text: What does Ramsay Bolton do to Theon Greyjoy so that he will call himself
    "Reek"?
  CorrectAnswer: Tortures him sadistically in many ways.
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Asks nicely.
  - Threatens to kill Theon's baby sister.
  AnswerExplanation: One of the most devious parts of Ramsay's torture of Theon was
    pretending to be his friend, helping him escape, and then leading him back to
    the torture chamber and telling his men to refasten him to the rack "back where
    he belongs."
