  Text: When did Daenerys receive the dragon eggs?
  CorrectAnswer: They were a wedding gift from Magister Illyrio.
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - They were a welcome gift after arriving at the city of Astapor in Slaver's Bay.
  - She found them the first night she traveled with the Dothraki.
  - A scout brought them to her after exploring the Red Waste and trying to find
    shelter.
  AnswerExplanation: The last surviving dragons in the world were possessed by House
    Targaryen, who used them to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
    The dragons eventually died out and the species was considered to be extinct
    throughout the world.
