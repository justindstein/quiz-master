  Text: Who is the only one of the Fellowship who refuses to go into Lothlorien?
  CorrectAnswer: Boromir
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Gimli
  - Aragorn
  - Frodo
  Hints: []
  AnswerExplanation: Boromir, the evil in him starting to come out, refuses to go
    to Lothlorien, stating that it is 'an evil place, that is what we say in Gondor.'
    Aragorn states that the only evil in Lothlorien, is the evil that men bring in
    with them. (Very Foreshadowing for poor Boromir). Gimli, of course is also reluctant.
