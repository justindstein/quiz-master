  Text: What was Lord Petyr Baelish's role on the Small Council?
  CorrectAnswer: Master of Coin
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
  - Master of War
  - Master of Ships
  AnswerExplanation: "Baelish, popularly called Littlefinger, gets to deliver these
    memorable lines: \"Chaos isn\u2019t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to
    climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are
    given a chance to climb, but refuse. They cling to the realm, or love, or the
    gods\u2026illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is. But
    they\u2019ll never know this. Not until it\u2019s too late.\""
