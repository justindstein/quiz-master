  Text: 'Who said this memorable line: "You''re very kind. Someday it will get you
    killed."'
  CorrectAnswer: Sandor Clegane, the Hound
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Brienne of Tarth
  - Melisandre
  - Samwell Tarly
  AnswerExplanation: While traveling to Eyrie to ransom Arya Stark to Lysa Arryn,
    they take shelter with a farmer who offers them refuge. The next morning, Arya
    discovers Sandor has robbed the farmer and is extremely angry, but the Hound
    is pragmatic, saying the farmer will die by winter due to lack of resources and
    protection, dead people don't need money, and Arya needs to learn to make ugly
    decisions.
