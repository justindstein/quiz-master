  Text: What does Tyrion murder his father with?
  CorrectAnswer: Crossbow
  IncorrectAnswers:
  - Poison
  - Sword
  - Mace
  AnswerExplanation: When Tywin calls Shae a whore yet again, it is the final straw,
    and Tyrion shoots him in the stomach. Stunned and shocked, Tywin hisses "you're
    no son of mine". Tyrion replies that he is, and always has been, his son.
